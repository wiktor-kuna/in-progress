## About configuration
1. You have to configure and run your SQL database (the draw of DB you can found in **apka_test.sql** file). 

    > The configuration of connection with database is in ***./utils/db.js*** file.

2. Look at ***config.js*** file.

3. Run this server (**npm start**) and go to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/ "your local server")
